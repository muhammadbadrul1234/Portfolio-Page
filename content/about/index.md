Hello! Interestingly, I am Muhammad Badrul.
Finding creative solutions to problems is something I have always enjoyed. As a kid I loved tinkering with things that were broken, figuring out how they worked, and fixing them again. When I finished high school, I knew exactly what I wanted my career to be.

I got introduced to competitive programming in my 2nd year at [Leading University, Sylhet](https://www.lus.ac.bd/) where I am completing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2020-Now) with **79.3% aggregate**.

I'm currently working as a Freelance Software Engineer at [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/badrulalom?up_rollout=true) and **Upwork**. My responsibilty includes **Java/C++/C#/C/Python** based projects as well as development & testing.

If you are interested in contacting me in regards to a position with your company, please email me at badrulalomtawsyat@ieee.org , or feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammadbadrul/)

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
